I'm a Physics Ph.D. student at [Yale University](https://physics.yale.edu/), working with Prof. [Frank van den Bosch](http://campuspress.yale.edu/vdbosch/) on semi-analytical modeling dark matter subhalo evolution, informed by idealized numerical simulations. I also work with Profs. [Daisuke Nagai](http://www.astro.yale.edu/nagai/) and [Jessi Cisewski-Kehe](http://www.stat.yale.edu/~jc3222/) on using machine learning and topological data analysis techniques to develop novel statistical frameworks for constraining cosmology via galaxy clusters and cosmic voids.

My publication record is available on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/green_s_2.html) and the [NASA ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu//#search/q=%3Dauthor%3A%28"Green%2C Sheridan B"%29&sort=date desc%2C bibcode desc&p_=0).
