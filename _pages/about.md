I'm a Physics Ph.D. candidate and NSF Graduate Research Fellow at [Yale University](https://physics.yale.edu/), working with Prof. [Frank van den Bosch](http://campuspress.yale.edu/vdbosch/) on semi-analytical modeling dark matter subhalo evolution, informed by idealized numerical simulations. In an unrelated direction, I am also using numerical simulations to study the impact of dynamical friction on globular clusters and supermassive black holes in fuzzy dark matter scenarios. I also work with Profs. [Daisuke Nagai](http://www.astro.yale.edu/nagai/) and [Jessi Cisewski-Kehe](http://www.stat.yale.edu/~jc3222/) on using machine learning and topological data analysis techniques to develop novel statistical frameworks for constraining cosmology via galaxy clusters and cosmic voids.

My publication record is available on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/green_s_2.html) and the [NASA ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=orcid%3A0000-0001-9100-6237&sort=date+desc). I have lead and collaborated on multiple papers that apply machine learning and topological data analysis to problems in cosmology.

In addition to research, I haved worked as a McDougal Teaching Fellow at the Yale Center for Teaching and Learning, where I have facilitated teaching workshops and provided classroom observations as part of the Graduate and Postdoctoral Teaching Development program.

My career interests lean towards quantitative research in the financial services industry, although I am also generally interested in exploring mathematical/statistical/data-driven research career opportunities across the industry, government, and academic sectors. Currently studying quantitative finance and algorithmic trading.

Aside from my academic work, I spend much of my time listening to and playing music. I'm currently (re-)learning how to play the piano, and I'm really interested in analog music synthesis. These days, you can usually catch me listening to some form of downtempo electronica, classical, or metal. Below is my most recently played track:
