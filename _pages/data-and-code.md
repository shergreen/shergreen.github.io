On this page, I plan to provide access to various codes that I have used throughout my research. I aim to release two different types of code: (i) tools that may be of use to others in their own work and (ii) scripts, Jupyter notebooks, etc. used to generate my results, in the interest of scientific reproducibility.

I'm making an active effort to build [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/shergreen) for my various projects.

### Tools:
* [**nbodipy**](https://github.com/shergreen/nbodipy): An NFW N-body simulation initial condition generator
* [**pyPPCA**](https://github.com/shergreen/pyppca): A Python module for probabilistic principle component analysis, a robust method for imputing missing data based on the inferred principle components

### Databases:

The [DASH database of subhalo evolution](https://cosmo.oca.eu/dash/), released in [Ogiya et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stz375). 

### Reproducibility:

To be added soon: Analysis notebooks used to generate results of evolved subhalo density profiles discussed in [Green et al. (2019a)](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/advance-article/doi/10.1093/mnras/stz2767/5580653?guestAccessKey=0023e643-03a5-4b95-bdab-5f6daaab56f1).

To be added soon: *Magneticum* mock cluster catalog and trained random forest model for predicting X-ray cluster masses, in addition to the Jupyter notebook used to generate results in [Green et al. (2019b)](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ab426f).
