In the summer of 2018, I helped organize a lecture series on topics not ordinarily covered in an introductory cosmology course but generally relevant to research in cosmology and galaxy evolution. The syllabus is listed below, with links to the accompanying lecture notes. We plan to incorporate special topics lectures eventually, with an emphasis on applications of data science to cosmology.

1. Spherical Collapse Model
2. Perturbation Theory
3. Halo Mass Functions (Press-Schechter)
4. Extended Press-Schechter and Halo Bias
5. Halo Model & Correlation Functions
6. Gravitational Lensing
7. Baryon Acoustic Oscillations
8. Gravitational Waves
9. Thermal and Kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effects
10. Applications of Neural Networks to Galaxy Evolution
